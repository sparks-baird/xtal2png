# Examples

Various Jupyter notebooks that cover primary usage and peripheral concepts/functionality
of `xtal2png` are included here. Many of these examples can be run on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and
have a corresponding clickable badge at the top of the notebook. For example, here is
the badge for the tutorial notebook:

target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg"
alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

These resources can also be downloaded directly from GitHub
([notebooks](https://github.com/sparks-baird/xtal2png/tree/main/notebooks),
[scripts](https://github.com/sparks-baird/xtal2png/tree/main/scripts)).
